# Automated-Cow-Data-extraction-NLP-PROJECT-

**Automated Cow Data Extraction**
This repository contains a Python program for automatically extracting cow identification (ID) and milk yield information from audio recordings of farm workers announcing milking data.

**Overview**
In dairy farms, workers verbally report cow milking data after each session. This project aims to streamline data collection processes by automating the extraction of cow IDs and milk yields from audio recordings. The program utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and regular expressions to transcribe audio, extract relevant data, and enhance accuracy.
